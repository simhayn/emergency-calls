## Project Description

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle containing emergency call information, including details such as the type of emergency, location coordinates, and timestamps. The goals of this project include:

- Analyzing trends and patterns in emergency call data.
- Visualizing call volumes over time, by location, and by type of emergency.
- Exploring correlations and insights to aid emergency response planning.

## Data Source
The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle's 911 Calls dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) (Provided in the file "911.csv"). It includes information such as:
- Latitude and longitude of the emergency call
- Description of the emergency
- Zip code and township of the emergency location
- Timestamp of the call
- Type of emergency (e.g., EMS, Fire, Traffic)
  

## Usage
Open the notebook and view the project: [notebook](emergency-calls.ipynb)

## Features
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze call volumes, trends, and geographical distribution.
- Visualization: Use matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualizing emergency call data.
- Insights: Gain insights to aid emergency response planning.
